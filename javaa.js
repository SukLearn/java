// User logs in and server creates a session. Server stores the session data (like user ID) in memory or a database. Server sends a cookie with a session ID to the client. On each request, the cookie is sent automatically by the browser to the server. Server checks the session ID and retrieves user data.
// User logs in and server generates a signed JWT token. Token contains payload (e.g. user ID, roles) and is sent to the client. Client stores the token (usually in localStorage or memory). On each request, the token is sent in the Authorization header. Server verifies the token signature and extracts user info from payload.
